    h5: a href="mailto:adamwong246@gmail.com" adamwong246@gmail.com
    p This is the personal blog of Adam Wong, RoR developer <i>par excellence.</i>

    p When I'm not coding, I practice muy thai kickboxing and brazillian jiu jitsu. I have two dogs, a cat, burning love for Ubuntu and a wonderful boyfriend. I live in Portland, Oregon. 

    p I'm always looking for new opportunities. Are you looking for a really good Rails dev and a sorta-pretty good designer? Oh yeah, did I mention I've got Android experience? If you are looking for a passionate and driven code head, I'm your man.

    p
      span.label.label-warning Warning

      u StEnki is a work in progress. Things will break, please don't abuse StEnki, etc.

      span.label.label-warning Warning

    p StEnki is a Ruby on Rails blog engine. Forked from Enki, it features many differences and a cornucopia of gems. It is not made to run on older browsers.
